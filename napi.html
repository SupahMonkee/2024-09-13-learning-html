    <br>
    I want to tell an old history about <b>Napi</b>.
    <p></p>
    <b>Napi</b> chose a large area of land, East of the
    Rockies.
    <p></p>
    <b>He</b> put on there, all the different animals that walk on <font color="blue">Mother</font> <font color="green">Earth</font>, the water animals, the ones that fly.
    <p></p>
    <b>He</b> built the rivers and landmarks in this area and they were all named in Blackfoot.
    <p></p>
    When <b>He</b> came to build, put the buffalo
    on <font color="blue">Mother</font> <font color="green">Earth</font>, all the rest would kill another, eat one another.
    <p></p>
    <i><b>“But the buffalo,”</i></b> <b>He</b> said to himself, <i><b>“I should put
    on <font color="blue">Mother</font> <font color="green">Earth</font>, people similar to me, so they can make use of the buffalo.”</i></b>
    <p></p>
    This natural area had natural boundaries.
    <p></p>
    To the South was the <font color="orange"> Yellow</font><font color="grey">stone</font> River and to the West was the Rocky Mountains, as far North as the Saskatchewan
    River,
    East to the Cyprus Hills.
    <p></p>
    Now <b>He</b> knew all the areas and when <b>He</b> put the buffalo on <font color="blue">Mother</font> <font color="green">Earth</font>, <b>He</b> built, He put
    everything in twos, the male and female.
    <p></p>
    <br>

    <p></p>
    <br>
    So the buffalo had a male and a female.
    <p></p>
    And to the same area where he molded
    the different animals, <b>He</b> took clay, he molded it into a person.
    <p></p>
    <b>He</b> opened its mouth and blew into it.
    <p></p>
    It started
    breathing.
    <p></p>
    <b>He</b> already tanned some hides for the breech cloth, leggings and shirt.
    <p></p>
    And as they were walking away, <b>He</b> was
    to be able to communicate with all the different animals.
    <p></p>
    And <b>He</b> communicated with the man.
    <p></p>
    And <b>He</b> figured: <i><b>“I made all
    the animals in pairs. Let’s go back to that clay and I’ll make the woman.”</b></i>
    <p></p>
    So they went back to the clay and they molded
    a woman, clothed her with buck skin.
    <br>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
